## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I got more practices with flexbox for layout of the different parts of the design. I also had a chance to do a media query to set the design to be responsive on mobile. As I complete various challenges, I feel I get a bit better at this frontend development.

### Continued development

I would like to continue with flexbox and start some grid layouts to further my skills in laying out different and more complex layout/designs.
